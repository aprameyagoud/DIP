# Digital Image Processing - Color to Grayscale and Channel Separation

This MATLAB project demonstrates basic image processing operations:
- RGB to Grayscale conversion
- Grayscale to Black-and-White (binary) conversion using mean thresholding
- Extraction of Red, Green, and Blue color channels
- Visual display of all outputs using `subplot`

---

## 📁 Files
- `cat.jpg` — Input image (must be in the same folder as the script)
- `EXP_1.m` — Main MATLAB script containing the processing logic

---

## 🧠 What the Code Does

1. **Reads an RGB image**
2. **Converts it to grayscale** using the average method
3. **Applies mean thresholding** to generate a black-and-white image
4. **Separates individual RGB channels**
5. **Displays** all outputs in a `2x3 subplot` layout

---

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Open MATLAB
2. Place the script and `cat.jpg` in the same working directory
3. Run the script:
   ```matlab
   EXP_1
